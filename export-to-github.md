# Exporting Your Replit Project to GitHub

## Method 1: Using Git Commands Directly

1. Create a new repository on GitHub at https://github.com/new
   - Give it a name (e.g., "electric-motor-logos")
   - Add a description (optional)
   - Choose public or private
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Copy the repository URL from GitHub (it will look like `https://github.com/yourusername/electric-motor-logos.git`)

3. Run these commands in your Replit shell, replacing `YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL` with your actual repository URL:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and personal access token (not your regular password)

   To create a personal access token:
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
   - Give it a name, set an expiration, and select the "repo" scope
   - Generate and copy the token to use as your password

## Method 2: Using GitHub Import Feature

If you're having trouble with Git commands in Replit, you can also:

1. Download your Replit code as a ZIP file:
   - Click on the three dots (...) in the Replit file explorer
   - Select "Download as zip"

2. Go to https://github.com/new/import
   - Select "Import repository"
   - In "Your old repository's clone URL", enter a placeholder URL
   - Name your repository
   - Choose public or private
   - Click "Begin import"

3. After the import is initialized, go to your new GitHub repository
   - Click "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop the ZIP contents or select them from your computer
   - Add a commit message
   - Click "Commit changes"

## Method 3: Using Replit's GitHub Integration

Replit also has built-in GitHub integration:

1. In your Replit project, click on the version control icon in the left sidebar
2. Click "Connect to GitHub"
3. Follow the prompts to authorize Replit and select or create your repository
4. Commit and push your changes through the Replit interface

## After Connecting to GitHub

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:
- Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Connect Netlify for continuous deployment
- Share the repository with collaborators
- Make changes, commit, and push using standard Git workflows
